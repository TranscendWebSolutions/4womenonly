## Resources for Women in need

Abundant Blessing
www.abundantblessingskids.com

We are clothing kids in dignity by providing clothing and shoes for children in need and foster children age newborn to 18 in a boutique setting. This allows our clients to select items that reflect their style while filling a basic need.

Our opening  slogan is 
Sharing God's Love from the hearts and closets of others. 
Sharing the gospel with women while blessing them with New and Gently used clothing.
